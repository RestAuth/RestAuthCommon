restauth-common 0.6.3 (01 March 2014)

  Distribution:
  * Move code to github: https://github.com/RestAuth/RestAuthCommon
  * No longer use bootstrap distribute installation but plain distutils.
  * Don't include the test.py file and generated documentation with pip.

  Features:
  * Add support for BSON ("Binary JSON") and MessagePack.
  * Remove the unmarshal() function. It's not used anywhere and since you have
    to pass the type anyway, it offers nothing over using the functions
    directly.
  * Make sure functions always raise MarshalError/UnmarshalError and wrap any
    exceptions thrown by libraries they use.
  * bytes, str and unicode can now all be handed to marshal_ functions, the
    marshalled output will be identical.
  * Unmarshalled strings will always be unicode in py2 and str in py3.
  * The constructor now sets any keyword arguments as instance attributes.
  * Remove the boolean type, since its not used anywhere anyway.
