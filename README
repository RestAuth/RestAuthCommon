RestAuth
========

RestAuth[1] is a project providing shared authentication, authorization and
preferences. Shared authentication and preferences allow users to use a single
account on multiple services (such as websites, mail, system accounts, ...),
sharing preferences among those systems. Shared authorization allows
administrators to manage permissions for users in a central and easy way.

This project contains a few shared classes used by both RestAuth[2] and
RestAuthClient[3]. Our git repository can be found at git.fsinf.at[4]

is the server-side reference implementation of RestAuth. The most
up-to-date documentation can be found on this projects homepage[1]. Our git
repository can be found at git.fsinf.at[3], a github mirror is available
here[5].
