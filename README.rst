RestAuth_ is a project providing shared authentication, authorization and
preferences. Shared authentication and preferences allow users to use a single
account on multiple services (such as websites, mail, system accounts, ...),
sharing preferences among those systems. Shared authorization allows
administrators to manage permissions for users in a central and easy way.

This project contains a few shared classes used by both `RestAuth server`_ and
RestAuthClient_. This git repository is just used as a mirror, the master
repository can be found at https://git.fsinf.at/restauth/restauth-common.
