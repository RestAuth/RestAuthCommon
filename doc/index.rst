   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to RestAuthCommon's documentation!
==========================================

RestAuthCommon is a small project that collects various code that is used in
both `server <https://redmine.fsinf.at/projects/restauth-server>`_ and 
`client <https://redmine.fsinf.at/projects/restauth-python>`_ reference
implementations, which are both written in python.

It contains very little code and is most likely not very useful outside the
context of the two projects that depend on it.
